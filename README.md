The file stress.m contains the various differential equations that represent the reactive scope model.  Different versions of the model can be used by commenting out unwanted versions.

The file stress_model_script.m generates numerical solutions to the model using ode45 and generates all related figures.  Different versions of the stress schedule function can be used by commenting out unwanted portions.  All parameters must be set for both the stress schedule and the seasonality parameters.

Other files are superfluous and were not used for the publication.
